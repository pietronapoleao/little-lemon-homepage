# Little Lemon - Homepage Project

This is the final project for the **"HTML and CSS in Depth"** course by Meta.

## About

This project was developed as part of the course's final assessment. The task was to create a homepage for one of four fictional clients, based on their personas and business characteristics. I chose **Little Lemon**, a Mediterranean restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, known for traditional recipes with a modern twist.

## The Challenge

The project required applying HTML and CSS knowledge in a practical way, which involved:

- Structuring content using semantic HTML tags
- Creating a responsive layout with Flexbox and Grid
- Enhancing user experience through hover effects and animations
- Building a clean, user-friendly navigation system
- Designing with visual hierarchy and consistent branding
- Implementing a full reservation form

## Development Process

I focused on building a welcoming and flavorful experience that reflects the Mediterranean brand identity of Little Lemon. The homepage includes:

- A visually rich **hero section** with call-to-action
- Highlighted **menu items** organized in a responsive grid
- An **about** section featuring the restaurant‚Äôs founders
- A functional **reservation form**
- A structured **footer** with contact info and opening hours

### Technologies used:
- Semantic HTML5 (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, `<footer>`)
- CSS3 for layout, responsiveness, transitions, and animation
- JavaScript for mobile menu toggle functionality
